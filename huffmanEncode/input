Your program will input data for different sets of stockbrokers. Each set 
starts with a line with the number of stockbrokers. Following this is a line 
for each stockbroker which contains the number of people who they have contact 
with, who these people are, and the time taken for them to pass the message to 
each person. The format of each stockbroker line is as follows: The line starts 
with the number of contacts (n), followed by n pairs of integers, one pair for 
each contact. Each pair lists first a number referring to the contact (e.g. a "
1" means person number one in the set), followed by the time in minutes taken to
 pass a message to that person. There are no special punctuation symbols or spacing
