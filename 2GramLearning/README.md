2GramTextGen
============
This is a toy tool that can automatically generate a paragraph text. Main technology here is the Markov chain. Just have fun.

Technology
-----------
Suffix Array, Markov chain, 2-Gram, Random Choose.

How to user
-----------
Excute <i>make</i> for compile, than use <i>randGen</i> generate the text.
>
<strong>inputFile</strong>: training text, you can add more text here, one paragraph stands one line.
>
<strong>out.txt</strong>: generated text.

Example
----------
Most common spectral clustering algorithms from appropriate visual summaries and methods. To cope with only a densely connected groups in this also address this also address the layout modules which are that they are often outperforms traditional full stress model which we also address this paper enable a comprehensible interactive applications. Some applications such as vertex set of static force- directed graph. The graph into different graph to give some graphs of our algorithm works at the algorithm is o( as the performance of multivariate time series data with only a force- stress model, and complex clustered graph associated with the researchers unanimously confirm that is put on demand. This special type of human motion capture data navigation, and disadvantages of our algorithm is analyzed using an intuitive, which applies the system for data is converging. Our algorithm, and visualization of their work. Additionally, and adjustable views of large motion vectors by interpolation and application areas of evaluating clusterings and analysis support to be solved efficiently by- stress majorization algorithm for drawing undirected connected graphs that the traditional clustering is to implement, and adjustable views of an inherent grouping of evaluating clusterings and so that contain an intuitive, the runtime for detecting densely connected graphs. However, we present motionexplorer, by local computation. This paper, and drill- called edge bundles are used for undirected connected groups in this situation. The node positions for the much slower force- cluster, the task of graph and benchmarking cluster contains a novel algorithm is for a solution, and robust design study.
